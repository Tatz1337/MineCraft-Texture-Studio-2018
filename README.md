# MineCraft Texture Studio 2022 (WIP - Not Yet Changed)
Forked from MeicooSoft/MineCraft-Texture-Studio-2018. Project seems to be dead so I'll be attempting to pick up where they left off.

- Save your resource pack directly into your minecraft folder
- 3D preview of all the blocks in minecraft, with your changes reflected immediately
- Add a thumbnail to your resource pack
- Add a description to your resource pack
- Choose what textures you want to include in your resource pack
